Ride booking flow : Rider -> Driver

- User's End ::
   - 1. User enter the source and destination -> shows a route in map
   - 2. User confirms the route -> shows cab options
   - 3. User selects the Cab options -> Button to confirm the ride booking
   - 4. User confirms the Ride booking 

     - Driver's End :: 
       1. All the drivers who belongs to the cab options gets the incoming request
       2. Request shows users location pickup and drop.
       3. If Driver accepts
          - Request is delete to all other drivers and assigned to current Driver
       4. If Driver rejects
          - Do nothing.
       5. IF Driver accepts the request confirm is sent to user about the drivers location and etp
       6. User and driver no both sees the status of the ride.
       7. User can only see the status but driver can change it
       8. When driver reaches the pickup location he makes 'reached at location' -> user sees that driver has reached
       9. When user sits in cab driver marks ride started-> user now sees the estimated time of journey
       10. When reached the destination driver marks 'reached destination' -> users see rider completed and total time and fare
        
        

Driver registeration ::
Enters the details
- Name
- Car -> Name, Model, YOM
- license plate
- Phone

When a driver register its details are sent to admin
When admin verifies and accepts the request then only driver can login to portal
If unverified driver tries to login,
- Either is new driver
- Or he is under verification

FLOW


Admin
Admin visits /admin route
IF signed in the taken to AdminPanel else taken to admin/auth page
Auth Form will have only one input which lets the admin enter the email
When admin enters the email a magic link is sent to the email.
Admin clicks the magic link and he is logged in to the AdminPanel.
But after clicking on magic link if the admin is firt time sigining then he is 
taken to a page to add details like name and phone.
If not first time then taken to admin panel.



Driver
Driver visits /driver route

If signed in taken to Drivers Dashboard page.
If not similar to admin taken to driver/auth page
Driver enters the email, magic link is sent, driver click the magic link
If first time then needs to enter phone,name,car model,car name,license plate.
If not first time taken to Dashboard page.


User,
Similar to admin and driver, when user visits /user route,
flow is similar, just the user if first time then he needs to enter details like, name,phone.


Drivers Dashboard:
Driver see list of incoming ride request.
Each request show from whom, source location address, destination address and total distance of journey.
If the driver click on a request it shows two buttons to accepts or reject the request.
If the driver accepts the request he is assigned that ride request and that request is no longer show to other drivers , if he rejects the request,
it will still show to him and also to others.

After Driver accepts the request user and driver will both see the ride status.
User will only see ride status but the driver can change them.
Different statuses are,
- Request Accepted
- Reached pickup
- Start trip
- End trip

When can change the status by clicking on status button and it will reflect the change for both rider and driver and we will see
live status.



Rider books the cab:

When the rider books the cab, he sents his locations and cab type he have opted to backend
Backend search for the matching driver within proximity and if found, the driver is assigned to 
user/rider.

When the driver is assigned rider sees the live ride status which can be changed from Drivers dashboard by Driver only.






   
How will Admins identify themselves initially? Is there a pre-approved list of Admin emails, or can anyone sign up as an Admin? You might need a way to restrict Admin access (e.g., an invite-only system or a super-admin to approve new Admins).
- As of now anyone can become admin. We will work on superadmi logic later

What happens if an Admin rejects a Driver’s registration? Does the Driver get notified, and can they resubmit?
- As of now Admin wont reject any driver. Driver will just have to wait till the admin sees this deatils and assign cab type to him.
  So when the Driver sigins in if he still awaits the verification, we will show that under verification, login in afterwards.
AdminPanel could eventually include analytics (e.g., total rides, active Drivers) or tools to manage disputes—something to think about for scalability.
- Admin Panel could show all the riders and whether they are online or offline as of now.



How will Drivers indicate they’re “online” and ready to receive requests? Without an explicit “online/offline” toggle, you might accidentally send requests to inactive Drivers.
- We can  let driver to toggle online and offline for driver in drivers dashboard.
What if no Drivers accept a request? Does it timeout, or does the Rider get a “no drivers available” message?
- We will show rider try again after sometime no driver available.

The “live status” feature is great, but how will Drivers update their location in real-time? You’ll need a mechanism (e.g., periodic GPS pings) to keep the proximity search accurate.
- When driver changes the ride status,
  Accepts the request -> drivers location is the location he is at present.
  Reached pickup -> drivers location is the location where the rider is standing.
  Star trip -> drivers location is the location where the ride has started (same as riders pickup point)
  End trip -> drivers location is the drop off point of rider. 

How does the Rider cancel a ride? Before or after a Driver accepts? This could affect Driver availability and request visibility.
- If rider cancels the ride after the driver accepts the ride request then, the request is removed for everyone(all drivers, rider himself). 
What happens if no Driver is found within 10 km? Will the Rider get a retry option or a suggestion to choose a different cab type?
- We will tell now driver available, try again later






So there is a AuthForm which takes the email. When the form is submitted it send the an email to 
the user with the magic link.

Now we dont have separate forms for login, signin etc. We just have one form.

Now when the user click on the magic link i am making a api call to api/callback route.
This route basically exchanges the code in the magic link and a session is generated
and user is redirected to the the main trip/book-ride route.


Now lets say a user is new and he visits the app and sees AuthForm. He enters the email and magic link is sent to his email.
He the click the email and according to logic we redirects him to the book-ride route page. As of now its working fine.

When the user is authenticated using the email and magic link, supabase creates new user if not already created.
But i have dedicate  table for the user which have users name, phone etc info which need to be taken from the user.


Now what i want is that,
if a user who already signed in then we have his all details, so we take him to book-ride route page.
But if a user is new then we want him to enter his detials.

So what i want is when a user enter his email, we sent him a email with magic link. This magic  link on clicking makes a api call which create a session
for the user and redirects to book-ride.

So if we can do someting in between or after a session is create we take him to the page when he can enter his name,phone etc.
Now this is for only the new users. 









i have three frontend routes,

user/auth
driver/auth
admin/auth
all of the above will show same form


as of now this middleware seems to bother me very much. Neither the redirection or the route protection nothing works. in many of the api call it also gives me error too many redirects.
I want to re-write the this middleware. only the top part which was taken from supabase docs is correct. blew that everything is bullshit.
What iam trying to achieve is,



 first lets start with two main aspects,
 Either a user is authenticated or a user is not authenticated
 we check this by auth.getUser();


 now if a user is authenticated, there can be two conditions,
 either  isOnboarded or not.

 if not isOnboarded then based on the role we redirect to its onboarding page.
 if isOnboarded then we redirects to main page.


 if user is not authenticated all the paths  except the path which has auth in them are restricted.





list of all the frontend path:
/user/auth...
/driver/auth...
/admin/auth...
/user/trip...
/driver/dashboard...
/admin/dashboard...
/user/auth/onboarding/profile 
/driver/auth/onboarding/profile 
/admin/auth/onboarding/profile 


---------------------------------------------------

-> not authenticated
   - restrict:

     /driver/dashboard...
     /admin/dashboard...
     /user/auth/onboarding/profile 
     /driver/auth/onboarding/profile 
     /admin/auth/onboarding/profile 

   - allowed:
     /user/auth
     /driver/auth
     /admin/auth

---------------------------------------------------
-> authenticated

   -> not isOnboarded
      - restrict:
        /user/auth

RIDE BOOKING LOGIC FLOW::


Factors for a driver to receive a ride request from the rider,
1. Should have the same cab type for which the rider has opted.
2. Should be in the 5km proximity.
3. Driver's availability(not assigned to any other ride).
4. Should be online

Rider make a ride request. All the drivers sees that request if the driver meets the above factors.
At this point the request is awaiting to be accepted. When any of the eligible driver accepts the request
the request is removed from the request table. Now at this point since the request is accepted this request
gets converted to ride and an entry is created in ride table. This ride table hold info the rider/driver
both of their locations, ride status. From this table we will show the rider about the drivers details and driver the 
riders details. Both of them will see the status as live feed on their respective dashboard.
Now as the driver changes the ride status it is reflect for both driver and rider.
Once the the is completed, then this data can be used to show the rider and driver about the past rides they have undertook.
See they can see if the ride was completed successfully or cancel etc etc...
Now once the ride is successfully completed we can then generated a payment request.



SHOWING RIDE OPTIONS::

factors::
1. Driver should be in 5km radius
2. Driver should be online
3. Should not be assigned to other ride

When users/rider selects the pickup and drop location i want to show 
ride options, which are basically the cab types available for the route. So we make a api 
call and then and send a data like pickup and dropoff lat and long. Now database will check 
all the drivers who are online and are not assigned to other ride and 
are in proximity(5km away from the pickup point) we will get the information of 
the cabs and then categorized them according to the cab types auto,comfort and elite.
In frontend ui we only want to show three cab type available for that route.
when the user selects a cab type and clicks the button we then again send request to backend 
api and then create a ride request to eligible 
drivers(this time we also want to match the selected cab type by rider) then you know the rest




Well you did not not got my point. lets understand with scenario.

let me explain you the flow of ride request and driver assigning.
Let say there are three riders, r1, r2, r3
and three driver, d1, d2,d3

rider r1 makes request to d1, d2 and d3
rider r2 makes request to d2 and d3
rider r3 make request to d3

Now driver d2 accepts the request of rider r1,

This is how we are goonna update the rides_new table,


First we will change the status of the accepted request to = 'DRIVER_ASSIGNED' from 'SEARCHING'

Then,
1. Delete the r1's request from other driver
   - 1. Delete all entries where rider_id: r1 except the current accepted request

2. Since d2 accepted the request now d2 should be removed from all request-> he is now assigned
   - 1. Delete all enteries where driver_id:d2 except the current accepted request.



1. delete all entries where driver_id:d2 and rider_id not : r1
3. delete all the enteries where rider_id:r1 and not driver_id:d2.

Now when we want all the cab option we first get all nearby 
drivers. Then we want to remove all the drivers which have status other then 'SEARCHING' 
in rides_new table. If a entry in rides_new table with a driver_id has status other than
'SEARCHING' means the driver is assigned and we can consider him for cab option
